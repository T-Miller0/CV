## Thomas Miller

I am a University graduate who has decided to dive straight into coding at Makers Academy. I worked throughout my degree and also played 
rugby which has given me a love of working with people. 

I am currently studying at Makers Academy, upon completion I will be eager to start my first role as a Junior Developer bringing my 
skills along with me. I enjoy working in a supportive and cooperative environment where I will have the opportunity to grow my skills 
and knowledge. Throughout my time as a Junior Developer I would not only like to master the language(s) I am using but also learn new languages.

## Skills

#### Communication

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed.

I have played team sports from a very young age which started to develop my communication skills early on. I then progressed to county 
level in a couple of sports which demanded a much more efficient set of communication skills. Along with sport I have worked in retail 
for five years, both working with in a team and talking to customers.

#### Time Management

My time management improved while I was at University. However it improved greatly in my last year of university because of all of the 
commitments I had, I worked, played sport and I was renovating a property.
