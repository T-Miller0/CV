## Thomas Miller

I am a University graduate who has decided to dive straight into coding and studied at Makers Academy. I worked throughout my degree and also played rugby which has given me a love of working with people. 

Now I have completed my studies at Makers Academy, I am now eager to start my first role as a Junior Software Developer bringing my skills along with me. I enjoy working in a supportive and cooperative environment where I will have the opportunity to grow my skills and knowledge. I am keen to learn new technologies and improve the ones that I have used.

## Skills

#### Communication and Team Work

I have played team sports from a very young age which started to develop my communication skills early on. I then progressed to county level in a couple of sports which demanded a much more efficient set of communication skills. Along with sport I have worked in retail for five years, both working with in a team and talking to customers.

#### Time Management

My time management improved while I was at University. However it improved greatly in my last year of university because of all of the commitments I had, I worked, played sport and I was renovating a property. All of these commitments required a significant amount of desired time and could not be postponed.
