## Thomas Miller

I am a University graduate who has decided to dive straight into coding at Makers Academy. I worked throughout my degree and also played rugby which has given me a love of working with people. 
I am currently studying at Makers Academy, upon completion I will be eager to start my first role as a Junior developer bringing my skills along with me. I enjoy working in a supportive and cooperative environment where I will have the opportunity to grow my skills and knowledge.
